          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Here is where you can read a little about meâ€”my bio.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          My name is [REDACTED], but online I go by a few different handles. On
          here, you can call me MintKick!
        </p>
        <p>
          My ideas are ambitious, and as a perfectionist, I have a high standard
          of quality. I learn music theory and techniques and strive to keep
          myself in practice, developing both my composition and improvisation
          while honing my creative skill. With 16+ years of musicianship, I have
          a lot of compositional works under my belt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up with four brothers and two sisters above me in a house full
          of jokes and laughs, I have acquired experience, by osmosis, in skit
          writing, acting, editing, and production. I come at my video making
          with a comedic perspective, and like to present scenarios with
          humorous twists.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always had an insatiable desire and love to create, develop,
          and improve projects, either for art or entertainment. This is where I
          want to show you my stuff!
