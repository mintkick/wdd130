              What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year
              of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips
              down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our
              favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed
              them to our family. The season started off with some chilly
              weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold and
              loved every minute of their trip. Later the temperatures soared
              reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon.
              We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those
              temperatures.

            <p>
              Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the
              United States. We share these areas with lots of critters both
              large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should
              find yourself face to face with one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of
              them being harmless. There are, however, a handful of them that
              can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be
              found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their
              environment. The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand
              Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United
              States. Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to
              their prey and luckily humans are not on that list!
            </p>
            <p>
              They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They
              will eat crickets, moths, spiders and other insects. Many compare
              their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be found with ice,
              aspirin and time.
            </p>
            <p>
              When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at
              night. Always wear your shoes or sandals. Always have a light with
              you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a scorpion
              and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.
            </p>

              Big horn sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the
              rugged mountain west. It is one of two species of wild sheep in
              North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown
              fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing
              and smell that helps them detect and avoid predators.
              <img src="images/bighorn-ram.jpg" alt="image of a bighorn ram" />
            </p>
            <p>
              Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have
              horns but they are short with a slight curvature. Horns are used
              as tools for eating and fighting.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park
              service asks that you stay 100 feet away from big game animals.
              Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.

        <p>
          My name is [REDACTED], but online I go by a few different handles. On
          here, you can call me MintKick!
        </p>
        <p>
          My ideas are ambitious, and as a perfectionist, I have a high standard
          of quality. I learn music theory and techniques and strive to keep
          myself in practice, developing both my composition and improvisation
          while honing my creative skill. With 16+ years of musicianship, I have
          a lot of compositional works under my belt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up with four brothers and two sisters above me in a house full
          of jokes and laughs, I have acquired experience, by osmosis, in skit
          writing, acting, editing, and production. I come at my video making
          with a comedic perspective, and like to present scenarios with
          humorous twists.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always had an insatiable desire and love to create, develop,
          and improve projects, either for art or entertainment. This is where I
          want to show you my stuff!
