About Me
        My name is [REDACTED], but online I go by a few different handles. On here, you can call me Mintkick!	My ideas are ambitious, and as a perfectionist, I have a high standard of quality.	I learn music theory and techniques and strive to keep myself in practice, developing both my composition and improvisation while honing my creative skill. With 16+ years of musicianship, I have a lot of compositional works under my belt.	I study game design topics a lot in my free time, focusing on mechanics, storytelling, and the effects of music.	Growing up with four older brothers in a joking household, I have experience in skit writing, acting, editing, and production. I come at my video making with a comedic perspective, and like to present scenarios with humorous twists.	I have always had an insatiable desire and love to create, develop, and improve projects, either for art or entertainment.

<p>Introducing the Website
This website is a platform to present my personal content, allowing me to give my commentary on my creative process as well. The three main topics I will post about here are music, video, and games/miscellaneous.	In the music section, I will present some of my favorite or best songs.

      <h3>Now Hear This</h3>
      <p>
        The Beginnings
Music theory has fascinated me since I started taking piano lessons at 8 years old. …… Initially, when I was very young, I would play around and record music on our Roland midi keyboard. I loved playing with all the instruments and sounds it could make, but I doubt I sounded good at the time, hehe. My brother showed me how it used floppy disks to save recordings! No doubt I’ve spent years of my life on that thing, and we still own it. After that, I started composing little ditties in FL studio, a digital audio workstation that my brother uses.

<p>Progress
Admittedly, the software was too complex for me at the time, and my stuff still wasn’t very impressive. Since then, I got into trackers, which is a type of music software based on the format/structure/method of retro game consoles. My new playgrounds were DefleMask and FamiTracker. I started focusing on chiptune styles and techniques imitating the sound of classic Nintendo games. Learning from my limitations, I have always kept that discipline of using a few instruments, or voices, to evoke full music. focus on the simple/basic/foundation of good melodies. (I still use FamiTracker occasionally, when I want to make a more hardware-accurate/faithful 8-bit song.) I wanted to get my hands on orchestral sounds however, so I began writing in Anvil Studio, a really old midi editor. It was quite difficult for me to use, so I still kept my eyes out for something I could really be comfortable with.

<p>Where I Am Now
The platform I use now the most is a browser-based software called BeepBox. With it, I can write both with the orchestral sounds I’ve wanted to and with those classic retro tones of video games. The instrument editor is really versatile for synthesizing both of those kinds of sounds, too! BeepBox was actually something I played with many years ago back in my DefleMask days and had almost forgotten about. Since then it has been updated a few times, and I’ve come to appreciate it more.	Lately I’ve been dipping my toes into MuseScore. Updates on that will come as I have them. ^–^
