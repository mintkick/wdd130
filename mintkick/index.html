   <p>My name is [REDACTED], but online I go by a few different handles. On here, you can call me Mintkick!	My ideas are ambitious, and as a perfectionist, I have a high standard of quality.	I learn music theory and techniques and strive to keep myself in practice, developing both my composition and improvisation while honing my creative skill. With 16+ years of musicianship, I have a lot of compositional works under my belt.	I study game design topics a lot in my free time, focusing on mechanics, storytelling, and the effects of music.	Growing up with four brothers and two sisters above me in a house full of jokes and laughs, I have acquired experience, by osmosis, in skit writing, acting, editing, and production. I come at my video making with a comedic perspective, and like to present scenarios with humorous twists.	I have always had an insatiable desire and love to create, develop, and improve projects, either for art or entertainment.</p>
