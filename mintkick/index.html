          My name is [REDACTED], but online I go by a few different handles. On
          here, you can call me Mintkick! My ideas are ambitious, and as a
          perfectionist, I have a high standard of quality. I learn music theory
          and techniques and strive to keep myself in practice, developing both
          my composition and improvisation while honing my creative skill. With
          16+ years of musicianship, I have a lot of compositional works under
          my belt. I study game design topics a lot in my free time, focusing on
          mechanics, storytelling, and the effects of music. Growing up with
          four brothers and two sisters above me in a house full of jokes and
          laughs, I have acquired experience, by osmosis, in skit writing,
          acting, editing, and production. I come at my video making with a
          comedic perspective, and like to present scenarios with humorous
          twists. I have always had an insatiable desire and love to create,
          develop, and improve projects, either for art or entertainment.
