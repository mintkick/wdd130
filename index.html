        My favorite things to do are make skits and music! I play the piano but also make video-game-sounding songs. I am way into The Legend of Zelda series.

    <p>Something new for me in college life and living on my own is cooking. I don't considered myself a cook of any sort, so I'm excited (and nervous) to learn how to make meals that aren't sandwiches!</p>
    <p>ps my cat's name is amadeus but she's a girl :)</p>
