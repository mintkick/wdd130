        I've lived in CA basically my whole life. This is my second semester here in Idaho. My current major is Computer Information Technology, but I'm seriously considering changing it to something that is either more people-focused or artistic...
        My favorite things to do are make skits and music! I play the piano but also make video-game-sounding songs. I am way into The Legend of Zelda series.

    <p>Something new for me in college life and living on my own is cooking. I don't considered myself a cook of any sort, so I'm excited (and nervous) to learn how to make meals that aren't sandwiches!</p>
    <p>ps my cat's name is amadeus but she's a girl :)</p>
