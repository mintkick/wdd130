        My favorite things to do are make skits and music! I play the piano but
        also make video-game-sounding songs. I am way into The Legend of Zelda
        series.

      Something new for me in college life and living on my own is cooking. I
      don't considered myself a cook of any sort, so I'm excited (and nervous)
      to learn how to make meals that aren't sandwiches!
